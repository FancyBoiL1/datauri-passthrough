# DataURI-Passthrough
This goofy little github repository allows for a user to load scripts or "bookmarklets". Cannot effect chrome extensions without extra work.

To use this repo for reasons other than to stare at the code, use this link:
`data:text/html;base64,PGJvZHk+DQo8c2NyaXB0IHNyYz0naHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4uanNkZWxpdn

You can use this to run javascript and bookmarklets, just follow the directions in the prompts.

1. Type L in the first prompt if you are using a link, or type C if there is something you would like to script or you have it in your clipboard.
2. Then just write or paste in whatever you are gonna use.
