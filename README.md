# DataURI-Passthrough
This goofy little github repository allows for a user to dynamically load javascript sites, scripts or even "bookmarklets". 

To use this repo for reasons other than to stare at the code, use this link:

You can use this to run javascript and bookmarklets, just follow the directions in the prompts.

1. Type L in the first prompt if you are using a link, or type C if there is something you would like to script or you have it in your clipboard.
2. Then just write or paste in whatever you are gonna use.

[THIS CANNOT (EASILY) BE USED TO RUN JAVASCRIPT THAT EFFECTS COOKIES, PACKETS, AND CHROME EXTENSION SITES (data: urls have different permissions than other sites)]
